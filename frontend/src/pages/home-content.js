                Canadian charity, and we'll see to it that they have a simple time accepting it.
                Since there are no costs associated with participating in our gift-receiving
                programme, your charity of choice may use every dollar you donate to support the
                important work they are doing on behalf of Canadians just like you.

We are unable to accept vehicles with pending insurance claims. Vehicles that have liens or other encumbrances are not accepted.
